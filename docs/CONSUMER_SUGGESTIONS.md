# Consumer suggestions

Field notes from consumers adopting the libraries — **the open ones**. An item answered with a
`**Status —**` reply moves to [CONSUMER_SUGGESTIONS_HISTORY.md](CONSUMER_SUGGESTIONS_HISTORY.md),
which carries an index of every one and where it landed; the runbook for answering them is
[CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md](CONSUMER_TRIAGE_LOOP.md).

**This file is the inbox, so an empty one means nothing is owed** — which is the property the split
exists for, and the reason answered items do not stay here.

## The next item is S29

**Claim ids from here, never from what this file shows.** S1–S28 are all answered and live in the
history file, so an empty inbox says nothing about how many ids are taken — number from the corpus, or
the next report is a second S1. The number is computed rather than remembered:

```
.claude/triage-state.sh --next        # scans this file AND the history file
```

Ids are never reused, including for an item answered as a non-issue: the reply is part of the record and
a recycled id would collide with it.

## Nothing open

S1–S28 are all answered, as of 2026-08-12 — see
[CONSUMER_SUGGESTIONS_HISTORY.md](CONSUMER_SUGGESTIONS_HISTORY.md), whose contents list is the one-line
summary of every one. Seven spawned roadmap items — **RM43**, **RM44**, **RM45**, **RM46**, **RM47**,
**RM48**, **RM49** — and all seven shipped in 0.6.0, RM44 and RM49 on 2026-08-12 and the rest with the
design round on 2026-08-13; [RM_TOC.md](RM_TOC.md) is the index for that half and carries their status. The distinction the sentence was written for still holds:
*answered* means a consumer has a reply, never that the work is finished.

**S25 and S26 are answered but not yet installable**, which is a state this file had not carried
before: each fix is a new optional manifest field, so it is legal only in a **minor**, and the tree
still reads 0.5.4 because cutting a release is the maintainer's call. A reply that says "shipped in the
tree" means the code and tests are in `main`, never that a consumer can `pip install` it — check
[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for whether the version it names has actually been cut.

## Adding one

Append a `## Sn — <what happened>` section with the id above. Write the report, not a request: what you
ran, what you expected, what happened, and what you did about it meanwhile. A candidate fix is welcome
and so is a reason a candidate is wrong — several of the answers in the history file are shaped entirely
by a reporter's argument against their own first option.

Prose is left byte-for-byte when it is answered and when it is moved, so it stays the record of what was
observed rather than of what was decided.
