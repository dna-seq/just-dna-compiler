"""HuggingFace upload — publisher surface of the network tier.

Two publish shapes share one create-or-update pathway (``ensure_repo``):

* **module** — a compiled module's artifacts (weights/annotations/studies.parquet + manifest.json,
  and a logo and readme if present) to ``datasets/<repo>/data/<name>/``, matching the layout
  just-dna-lite's discovery scans (``upload_module``).
* **reference snapshot** — a built ClinVar (or Ensembl) parquet snapshot + ``release.json`` to the
  root of a dataset repo, matching the ``download.ensure_*_snapshot`` layout
  (``publish_reference_snapshot``).

Both require a HuggingFace token with write access (``hf auth login`` or ``HF_TOKEN``). This is the
**dev/publisher** half of the enricher's HuggingFace use: snapshot *download* is a runtime enrich
path (``download.ensure_snapshot``); *upload* is for authors republishing modules (e.g. the Gen-I
``v1-port`` recreation) or publishing a rebuilt reference. Install as ``just-dna-enricher[dev]``.

Extracted from ``just_dna_pipelines.v1_port.publish`` (just-dna-lite); ``create_repo`` was added here
(the origin assumed the repo pre-existed) so a brand-new dataset repo can be created on first push.

# never published, so anyone who *downloaded* the snapshot instead of building it had no PMIDs — and a
# drafted gene panel cannot compile without them, because `studies.csv` is mandatory.
#
# **`LICENSE.txt` was the second gap, and it is worse than the sidecars were.** ClinPGx ships its terms
# *inside* the archive the data came from, and the builder extracts them precisely so a holder of the
# snapshot can read what governs the bytes without going back to the archive — the whole pinned-licence
# design (`license_sha256`) rests on that file travelling with them. It was not in these patterns, so
