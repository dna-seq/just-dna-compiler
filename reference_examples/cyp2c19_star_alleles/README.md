# CYP2C19 — star alleles and clopidogrel, drafted from CPIC

The PGx counterpart to [`hfe_hemochromatosis/`](../hfe_hemochromatosis/), and the interesting thing
is how *differently* the two behave. The ClinVar panel came back with a hole a human had to fill.
This one came back **complete** — every column the models require was published — and what a curator
has to do instead is decide what to *remove*, and notice what the source never had.

## How it was built

```bash
just-dna-compiler scaffold reference_examples/cyp2c19_star_alleles --name cyp2c19_star_alleles
just-dna-enricher draft reference_examples/cyp2c19_star_alleles \
    --gene CYP2C19 --drug clopidogrel --population "CVI ACS PCI" --use non-commercial
# ... curation, below ...
just-dna-enricher enrich reference_examples/cyp2c19_star_alleles --offline
just-dna-compiler compile reference_examples/cyp2c19_star_alleles out/
```

1,477 rows across three tables, no placeholders, valid immediately. `--use non-commercial` is required
rather than polite: CPIC's terms forbid sale, so a draft is **skipped** when the use is unstated and
**refused** when it is commercial — the terms are accepted by taking the data, so the check happens
before anything is fetched.

## What the curator removed, and why a warning existed to prompt it

CPIC pairs every allele it knows into diplotypes, including alleles whose defining variants it does
not publish in a form this format can hold. `*36`, `*37` and `*42` arrived used across 71 diplotype
rows — two of them declared `no_function` — and defined in `haplotypes.csv` by nothing at all. A
star-allele caller can never emit an allele nothing defines, so every row about them was dead.

That is a cross-table redundancy the compiler can settle without any reference, so it now does:

```
warning: Star allele(s) used but not defined in haplotypes.csv: ['*36', '*37', '*42'].
         A consumer's caller cannot emit an allele nothing defines, so rows about it can never match.
```

The curation here was to drop them (666 → 595 diplotypes). A module that leans on an *external*
caller's definitions could legitimately keep them, which is why this is a warning and not an error —
and why the check only runs when `haplotypes.csv` is present at all.

## What CPIC could not express, reported rather than coerced

* **IUPAC ambiguity codes.** `*2`, `*4` and `*35` each have one defining variant CPIC records as `R`,
  `Y` or `M` — a *set* of nucleotides, not a nucleotide. `HaplotypeRow.allele` takes ACGT, so those
  rows are skipped with a warning rather than guessed. The alleles survive: each has other defining
  variants, so `*2` and `*4` are still callable — just from fewer positions than CPIC lists.
* **No numeric activity score.** All 666 diplotypes carry CPIC's `n/a`, which means *CPIC did not
  score this pair* — an absence, so the cell is simply empty. (Distinct from a value like `≥3.0`,
  which is a real bound the numeric bin columns cannot hold; the provider now says which it saw
  instead of calling both "an inequality".)
* **No chromosome.** CPIC's `sequence_location` publishes `genesymbol`, `dbsnpid` and `position` and
  no chromosome column, so a defining variant is identified by rsID or not at all — see below.

## The drug context, and why the population is a curation decision

`draft --gene CYP2C19 --drug clopidogrel --population "CVI ACS PCI"` adds 595 diplotype rows
carrying CPIC's prescribing recommendation on top of the 595 phenotype rows. They coexist because
they answer different questions and `_TABLE_DUPE_KEYS` keys on `drug`: the plain row says *what
phenotype this pair is*, the drug row says *what CPIC advises about it for this drug*.

`--population` narrows rather than decides. CPIC scopes clopidogrel to three clinical contexts —
`CVI ACS PCI`, `CVI non-ACS non-PCI`, `NVI` — and **they disagree**: `*2/*2` (Poor Metabolizer) is a
`strong` recommendation in `CVI ACS PCI` and `moderate` in `NVI`. When this module was drafted
`DiplotypeRow` had no column for that axis, so all three contexts collided as duplicate rows and the
provider refused rather than pick one; `--population` was the only way through, and this module was
drafted with `CVI ACS PCI` — the acute-coronary/PCI setting CPIC's clopidogrel guideline is written
around. RM29b (0.5.1) dissolved the refusal by adding `clinical_context` to the row and to the dedup
key, so today `draft --drug` writes every context as its own row and `--population` merely filters.

Note what that leaves on disk: these rows carry **no `clinical_context` column at all**, so the
setting they belong to is recorded in this paragraph and nowhere a consumer can read. Re-drafting the
module today would state it per row. The declaration is still the curation — it is just no longer the
only way to draft.

The `conclusion` is CPIC's own two halves, transcribed rather than summarized: the *implication*
(what the genotype does) followed by the *recommendation* (what to do about it).

`evidence_level` stays empty on purpose. That is PharmGKB's grade of how well established an
association is — a different axis from CPIC's `recommendation_strength`, which grades how firmly a
guideline tells a prescriber to act. Folding them into one column would be the `state`-overloading
mistake again, and the two bodies routinely disagree.

## What drafting a real gene taught the tooling

Three fixes, all in the provider rather than worked around here:

1. **`draft --gene CYP2C9` crashed** with a raw pydantic traceback. The skip guard checked "no rsID
   *and* no position", but `HaplotypeRow` needs an rsID *or* chromosome **and** position — and CPIC
   never publishes a chromosome. 18 CYP2C9 defining variants have a position and no rsID, as do 14 in
   TPMT and 4 in NUDT15. CYP2C19 has none, which is exactly why the provider looked fine. A guard
   that does not match the model it builds is not a guard.
2. **`n/a` was reported as "an inequality rather than a number"**, which is simply the wrong reading
   of it, and it was emitted once per row — ~600 identical lines for this gene, and 2,184 for CYP2C9,
   burying every other finding. Now classified and aggregated, with the total stated.
3. **Nothing recorded CPIC as a source.** The provider checked the licence before fetching and then
   wrote no `SourceRow`, so a module built entirely out of CC BY-SA no-sale data carried no
   `sources.csv` and the compile gate had nothing to refuse on. That is the `clingen.py` bug, in the
   newest provider. `sources.csv` here is the fix; strip its `declared_use` and the compile fails.
